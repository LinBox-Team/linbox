LinBox/Maple Interface - version0.3
8- -2002

1.  What is it
	This is an interface between the LinBox library of functions and
utilities for the Maple computer algebra system.  It is currently under
development by Rich Seagraves at the University of Delaware.  Any ideas or
suggestions are more than welcome.  The package is made up of a small library
that wraps LinBox functions, and a module called LinBox that contains all
procedures and external calling definitions.  A new version of the interface is
underway that does such things as provides external storage of LinBox BlackBox
and Vector types, as well as access to more LinBox functions.


2.  Requirements:
	The interface requires the following packges:
	I.  Maple v6.0 or greater
	II. LinBox
	III. GMP v3.2 or greater (for LinBox)
	IV.  unix make utility

	It is recommended you have the following
	I.  Maple v7.0 or later
	II. g++ 3.0 or later (compiler on which this library was tested).

3.  Availability.
	The current release of this library can be obtained via HTTP from
http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~seagrave/MapleLB.tgz.  The package can also be
obtained from the LinBox team's CVS server at linbox.pc.cis.udel.edu.  Contact
root@linbox.pc.udel.edu for access to that server.  The bleeding edge version
of the package is availabe from that server under the unit name MapleLB

	At the moment, the package has been tested under SUN Solaris and
theoretically will only work on Unix variant systems (sorry everybody, my
knowledge of .dll files is lacking).  As more people download the package and
test it out, I can make it more robust.  If a windows user feels up to figuring
out a window's build system, I would be more than happy to include it.

4.  Installation
	The interface is pretty simple at this point, 1 include file and a
source file.  Thus the build system is little more than a makefile that
requires some editting.  You will be required to know about how Maple, GMP, and
LinBox were installed on your system.  There will be instructions in the
makefile on how to do that.  Once that's done, just type
	make install
and the makefile should do the rest.

5.  Usage
	The makefile will generate a script file containing the proper 
definition of the interface for your system.  It is called linbox.mpl.  In
Maple, type "read "/directory/you/installed/to/linbox.mpl"; at the prompt to
get the module.  The package also contains worksheet called
demonstration.mws that demonstrates the usage of the interface.

6.  Wow, this interface is horrible.  What's wrong with you?
	Hey, give me a break, this is a demonstration.  I've got something
better in the works.  If you think it's that bad, why not send me some
constructive criticism or help.  I always love help.
