Try:
	Create new valueless sparse representation
	Try changing INIT_ALLOC to eliminate the need for doubling
	    during transpose
	Delay transpose computation until after inverse computation

Todo:
	Add test for dense/sparse and dense/compact sparse row operations
	Add support for sparse/* row operations
