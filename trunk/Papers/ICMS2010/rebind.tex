\subsection{Rebind of coefficient domains}
\subsubsection{Mapping of data between domains}
\linbox makes use of the concept of rebinds for the mapping of data
structures between different coefficient domains.
For instance, in the context of the Chinese remainder algorithm rebinds
allow to map a matrix over the integers of type, say,
(\texttt{DenseMatrix<PID\_Integer>}) to a modular matrix of type, say,
\\(\texttt{DenseMatrix<Modular<double> >}).

In \linbox, binder adaptors are enclosed
within many data structures and make use of a generic
converter, named \texttt{Hom} and found in \url{linbox/field/hom.h}.
\texttt{Hom} can generically use the \linbox domain's canonical
conversion methods methods \url{init} and \url{convert} from/to the \linbox
Integer type: \texttt{Domain1} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{Integer}
$\rightarrow$ \texttt{Domain2}. 
Moreover, when natural, efficient conversions exists between domains
(e.g. different representations of the same field or one ring embedded in another), generic \texttt{Hom} can be directly bypassed by a specialization of \texttt{Hom}.

\begin{paragraph}
{\em Rebind of matrices.}
We illustrate the founding scope allocation model with the use of rebind
functions adapted from the allocators in the STL, on dense matrices.
\begin{verbatim}
template <class Domain> class DenseMatrix {
  typedef DenseMatrix<Domain> Self_t;
  ... 
  template<class AnyDomain> struct rebind{ 
     typedef DenseMatrix <AnyDomain> other;
     operator ()(other& Ap, const Self_t& A, const AnyDomain& D){
       // Performs the modular conversion of A to Ap over D
       ...
     } 
  };  
}
\end{verbatim}
According to the founding scope allocation model, the function
\texttt{operator()} in charge of the initialization of the matrix cannot 
allocate any memory. This has to be done at the level where the
rebind is called. This also requires a modification of the rebind
operator interface of the STL: the new object is passed by reference.
