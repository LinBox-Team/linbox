	We describe in this paper new design techniques used in the \cpp exact
	linear algebra library \linbox, intended to make the library
	safer and easier to use, while keeping it generic and efficient.

	First, we review the new simplified structure for containers, based on
	our \emph{founding scope allocation} model. We explain design choices
	and their impact on coding: unification of our matrix classes, clearer
	model for matrices and submatrices, \etc

	Then we present a variation of the \emph{strategy} design pattern that
	is comprised of a controller--plugin system: the controller (solution)
	chooses among plug-ins (algorithms) that always call back
	the controller. We give examples using the solution \mul.

	Finally we present a benchmark architecture that serves two purposes:
	Providing the user with easier ways to produce graphs;
	Creating a framework for automatically tuning the library and supporting
	regression testing.
