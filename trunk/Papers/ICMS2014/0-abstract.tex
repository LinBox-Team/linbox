	We develop in this paper design techniques used in the \cpp exact linear
	algebra library \linbox. They are intended to make the library safer
	and easier to use, while keeping it generic and efficient.

	%
	First, we review the new simplified structure of the containers, based
	on the \emph{mother model} (cf. \cite{Dumas:2010:lbpar}).  Namely,
	vectors and matrix are all templated by a field and a storage type.
	Matrix interface all agree with the same minimal blackbox interface. We
	explain the design choices and their impact on coding.	%
	\par
	%
	Then we present a variation of the \emph{strategy} design pattern that
	is comprised of a controller--plugin system: the controller (solution)
	chooses among plug-ins (algorithms) and the plug-ins always call back
	the solution so a new choice can be made by the controller. We give
	examples using the solution \mul.  We will describe
	serveral of the new containers, especially our sparse and dense
	matrices storages as well as their \apply method and compare to previous
	implementations.

	%
	\par
	%
	Finally we present a benchmark architecture that serves two purposes.
	The first one consists in providing the user with an easy way to
	produces graphs using \cpp. The second one is to create a
	framework for tuning the library and doing regression testing.
