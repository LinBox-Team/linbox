	 * The matrix itself is not stored in memory.  Rather, its apply
	 * methods use a vector of {@link Fields field} elements, which are 
	 * used to "multiply" the matrix to a vector.
	 * 
	 * This class has three template parameters.  The first is the field in 
	 * which the arithmetic is to be done.  The second is the type of 
	 * \Ref{LinBox} vector to which to apply the matrix.  The 
	 * third is chosen be default to be the \Ref{LinBox} vector trait
	 * of the vector.  This class is then specialized for dense and sparse 
	 * vectors.
	 *
	 * @param Field \Ref{LinBox} field
	 * @param Vector \Ref{LinBox} dense or sparse vector of field elements
	 * @param Trait  Marker whether to use dense or sparse LinBox vector
