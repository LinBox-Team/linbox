	 * Unlike the LinBox field common object interface,
	 * the common object interface for LinBox BlackBoxes does not require
	 * the copy constructor.  All object management routines are given 
	 * through virtual clone and killclone methods.  This allows the base
	 * object to be the archetype, which is not possible for LinBox fields. 
	 *
	 * In general, there are three uses of archetypes:
	 * \begin{enumerate}
	 * \item To define the interface, i.e., document what an
	 *       explicitly designed field class must have.  This is
	 *       useful, for instance, in building a wrapper or adaptor
	 *       to an existing library.
	 * \item To distribute compiled code and ease the testing of
	 *       library components.
	 * \item To control code bloat.
	 * \end{enumerate}
	 * Because of their use of virtual member funtions, these archetypes can be 
	 * inefficient.

	/** 
	@memo BlackBox base class and archetype 
	@doc 
	This archetype is an abstract base class for blackbox matrix classes.
	The key member functions are ({\tt apply, applyTranspose, rodwim, coldim}, are pure virtual,
	and hence are implemented in each child class.  
	
	Concrete classes inheriting from the archetype
	use a variety of representation schemes for matrices internally. 
	All provide the blackbox interface described here and can be used 
	interchangably in blackbox algorithms.
	Some also implement a dense matrix or sparse matrix interface to support elimination
	techniques.  Each has unique constructor(s) reflecting it's specific scheme for representing
	a linear operator.

	Algorithms written with a Blackbox template parameter 
	may be compiled against any of these classes specifically or may be separately compiled
	against the archetype.  Algorithms may also be written with a BlackboxArchetype parameter
	and then called with an instance of a concrete blackbox class. 
	In contrast with the situation for \Ref{Field}s there is 
	negligible performance cost for separate compilation here.
	
	{\bf Template Parameter:} Vector - A type meeting the LinBox \Ref{VectorArchetype} interface.
	Vectors of this type are the normal arguments to {\tt apply} and {\tt applyTranspose}.
	
	@see \Ref{../archetypes} for general discussion of LinBox archetypes.
