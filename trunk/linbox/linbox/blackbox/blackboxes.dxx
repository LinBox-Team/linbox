/** @name Blackbox Matrices

  All \Ref{LinBox} black box matrices must implement the black box matrix
  common object interface as it is defined in the black box matrix
  {@link Archetypes archetype}.  
  This interface consists of the methods required of all \Ref{LinBox} fields.

  In addition, all black box matrices should be derived from the 
  {@link Archetypes archetype}.
