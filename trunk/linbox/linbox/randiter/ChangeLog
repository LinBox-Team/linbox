	* archetype.h (LinBox): Guard against getting a random value when
	the element pointer is NULL

	* param-fuzzy.h (LinBox): Ditto here

	* gmp-rational.h (LinBox): Ditto here

	* param-modular.h (LinBox): Two versions of random: one that takes
	and returns a native element, and one that takes and returns an
	Element_abstract by wrapping the result of the former in an
	envelope
