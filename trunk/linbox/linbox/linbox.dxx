  LinBox is a C++ template library providing for exact linear algebra over arbitrary fields.
  It specializes in large sparse and structured problems over finite fields, but also contains
  capabilities for smaller matrices, dense matrices, and matrices over the integers.

  This beta release provides implementations of a number of finite field representations,
  and of a number of matrix types, especially for blackbox representation of sparse or 
  structured matrix classes. 

  A good collection of finite field implementations is available
  as is a suite of blackbox matrix classes.  
  Algorithms are in place for minimal polynomial, rank, determinant, solving systems,
  and a few others.
  Some algorithms are probabilistic and their results should be doubted over very small fields (less than 1000 elements).
  Algorithms for integer matrices are not completely in place.
  The documentation is rudimentary and algorithms are missing or suboptimal 
  for some linear algebra problems despite known good solutions.

  \URL[Project LinBox]{http://linalg.org}
  is a collaborative effort among researchers at a number of locations in 
  Europe and North America. The goals are to produce algorithms and software 
  for symbolic linear algebra, particularly using black box matrix methods, 
  i.e. iterative methods requiring only the linear transform property of the 
  matrix (that, given $A$ and $x$,  one can compute $y$ <-- $Ax$).
