/** \defgroup solutions linbox/solutions

These are problem oriented drivers providing simple interfaces for 
linear algebra functions.

The functions here allow some selection of algorithm and also provide 
for default algorithm choice.  Not every implemented algorithm is 
currently available through these calls, but this is a good starting 
point.  See \ref algorithms for other possibilities.
