/** \defgroup element linbox/element

The interface for field and ring element types.

The interface requirements are minimal and are specified
in \Ref{ElementArchetype}.

Developers:
Your element type may be almost any primitive type or defined class.
To support the field archetype there is also an \Ref{ElementAbstract}
and \Ref{ElementEnvelope}.
