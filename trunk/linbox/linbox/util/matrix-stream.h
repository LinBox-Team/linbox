/* matrix-stream.h
 * Take a file or stream of a matrix, return (row, column, value) triples from
 * that matrix.  Automatically determine matrix format.
 * 
 * NOTE to developers:  To add a new format, write a subclass of
 *                      MatrixStreamReader and put it in the formats
 *                      subdirectory.  Then you must add this new format to
 *                      the file formats/matrix-stream-readers.h in two
 *                      different places.  It should be clear how to do this if
 *                      you look at that file.  Once you do this, the new format
 *                      will automatically be used.
