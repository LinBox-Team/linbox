/** \defgroup field linbox/field

\brief LinBox fields, field wrappers, field construction tools.

LinBox fields implement the field concept
which is defined in the field archetype.  

Some implement a basic ring concept rather than a field
(inv and div are partial functions).  Ring representations with 
additional functions are also found in the ring directory.
