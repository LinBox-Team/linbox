/* \page Sparse Vector Archetype

  The \Ref{LinBox} sparse vector common object interface is the same as either
  the STL sequence of pairs of {\tt size\_t} and a {@link Fields field} element
  or an STL unique and pair associative container.  (That is, an STL map
  without the operator[].)
  Note \Ref{LinBox} vectors are  indexed starting at zero, not one, 
  just like STL vectors and C-style arrays.
  It is also always assumed that the entries in the sparse vector are in 
  ascending order starting with the first index no less than zero.

  For information on the STL vector, see SGI's 
  \URL[Standard Template Library Programmer's Guide]{http://www.sgi.com/Technology/STL/}.
