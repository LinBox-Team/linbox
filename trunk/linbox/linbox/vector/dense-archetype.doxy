/* \page Dense Vector Archetype

  The \Ref{LinBox} dense vector common object interface is defined by
  the STL vector.  For this reason, there is no dense vector archetype.
  Note \Ref{LinBox} vectors are  indexed starting at zero, not one, 
  just like STL vectors and C-style arrays.

  For information on the STL vector, see SGI's 
  \URL[Standard Template Library Programmer's Guide]{http://www.sgi.com/Technology/STL/}.

        dense vector common object interface.
