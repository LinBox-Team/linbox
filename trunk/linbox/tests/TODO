Functionality that needs to be tested:

 * Fields! (BDS: Nudge, nudge ;-)
 * applyTranspose, especially for sparse matrices
 * Compose
 * Transpose
 * Submatrix
 * Direct sum (when committed)
 * Hilbert
 * Permutation matrices (apply and applyTranspose)
 * Dense matrices (apply and applyTranspose)
 * Reading and writing matrices to/from disk
 * Printing matrices in human-readable format
 * Black box rank
 * Black box determinant

More generally
 * Timing information
