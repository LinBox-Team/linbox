The plan described below.  In practice some code of J-G is in by_library
and some code of WT is in by_scope.  My suggestion is that this directory
be not further used at all.  -bds.

wrappers : Wrappers for Libraries, plus Internal wrappers
           "wrappers" is organized by Library, each one of them
           having Field, Ring, BlackBox, Random ... as sub-directories

by_scope : NOT YET (next Makefile, or configure should generate it)
	   Will be links to wrappers/... but organized by scope.
	   i.e. contains Field, Ring, Blackbox, ... as sub-directories,
	   and each one of them contains every Library as a sub-directory
	   This directory is only for user convenience.

tools    : Some implementation tools, not really Linbox :
	   e.g. : Commentator, Sparse Vectors ...
