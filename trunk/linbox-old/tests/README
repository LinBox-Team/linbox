When running code dependent on dynamic libraries such as the gmp library
you must appropriately set your environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
so that at startup time the program is linked with the dynamically loaded
functions from the library.  For example (if using csh):

setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/algebra/gmp/lib

Remark:  you can find the location of the library from linbox/configure.status.


====================================================================
Sparse matrix format used is "sms"
the format is :
--
ni nj M
...
i j val
...
0 0 0
--
Where ni nj are the matrix dimensions
i (resp. j) are from 1 to ni (resp. nj)
and sorted by i then by j
Data is ended by 0 0 0
Examples are in Sequence/Examples/
Gauss and Wiedmeann routines accept also
gunzip-ed files.
