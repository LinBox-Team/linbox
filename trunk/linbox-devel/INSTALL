You will need LinBox proper, either from a recent tarball or the CVS
module. Download it and follow the instructions for setting it up. You
may choose to install it or not at your discretion.

When LinBox is properly installed, run autogen.sh:

./autogen.sh --with-linbox-prefix=<installed path>

or

./autogen.sh --with-linbox-sources=<sources path>

Use the former if you have run 'make install' from the LinBox source
directory; <installed path> is the prefix to which you installed
LinBox as given when setting up LinBox; the default is /usr/local.

Use the latter if you did not run 'make install' and would like to
work with the LinBox source tree directly. In this case <sources path>
is just the place where LinBox has been unpacked;
e.g. $HOME/linbox-0.1.3 if you unpacked linbox-0.1.3.tar.gz from your
home directory.

When ./autogen.sh is done, you are ready to work.
