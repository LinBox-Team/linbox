Summary of computing resources available at Delaware <br>
for the Spaghetto team - Linbox project.
</h1>
</center>

<ol>
<li>The group <strong>algebra</strong> for file access. <br>
<p>
Team members are all in the "algebra" group at Delaware.
</p>
<li>
The directory <strong><code>/usr/local/algebra/</code></strong>. <br>
<p>
This directory contains most files and directories of interest for computer 
algebra.  Directories or links are there for Maple, Mathematica, Saclib, etc.
In particular /usr/local/algebra/linbox/ holds project related stuff.
<p>
These directories belong to the algebra group.  Algebra group members
can write them.  Please be careful not to inadvertently remove something
there.  Also please follow the convention of making everything you put 
there at least readable/executable to algebra group members.  As much as 
possible please also make things writable by algebra group.
<p>
A good access policy is <code>chmod g+u [file]</code>
Thus make your usage compatible with <code>umask 002</code> or <code>007</code>.
<p>
You can change the group of a file with <code>chgrp algebra [file]</code>.
</p>
<li>
<strong>Local organization and administration</strong>.
<p>
A summary about the local setup is at the  
at <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/documentation/FAQ.html#Report-data"> 
EE/CIS FAQ page </a>.
Mike Davis <davis@eecis.udel.edu> is the chief systems administrator 
for the eecis network, a shared resource of the Computer and Information
Science and Electrical Engineering departments.  Problem reports and 
system queries can be sent to the newsgroup <code>system@eecis.udel.edu</code> for resolution.
External users please copy <code>saunders@eecis.udel.edu</code> when writing to system
so there is a local team member aware of the issue.
</p>
<li>
<strong>High Performance Cluster. </strong> 
<p>
These 16 machines each have 4 processors, 512Mb, and are connected by 
fast ethernet and Myrinet.  They do not share files with the rest of the 
eecis network.  Each machine has two names.  One of the names is a 
number prefixed by <strong>nsfri</strong>, thus <code>nsfri1 nsfri2 .. nsfri16</code>.  The second 
name is the name of a volcano, eg. <code>maui</code>.  You can use either one.  
If you find you do not have a home directory when you log on there, 
contact saunders to remedy that.  
<p>
Please use the cluster as a compute/development server only 
(avoid email, latex, netscape, ...).  For long and/or timed computations, 
use the reservation system.  For more info about the cluster see 
<br> <code> http://www.eecis.udel.edu/nsfri/.  </code>
</p>
<li>
<strong> Other machines. </strong>
<p>
ren and taygeta, for example, have the same architecture as the cluster
and are available for general purposes.
<p>
The local command <code>sysinfo [machine]</code> will give some specs on the machine.
Don't give <code>sysinfo</code> without an argument.  You will get a very long
output!
</p>
<li> <strong>Linbox project web page.</strong>

<p>
<code> http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~caviness/linbox/
</code>
<p>
For now this is a private web page for team communications.  
The directory is writable by group algebra, so you can add/modify
things on the web page.  Please do.
</p>
<li><strong> Misc.  </strong>
<pre>
/usr/local/gnu/bin/g++ ...
/usr/local/gnu/egcs/bin/g++ ...
