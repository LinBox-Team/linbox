<p>Project LINBOX is 
a collaborative effort
among researchers at a number of locations in Europe and North America.
The goals are to produce algorithms and software for symbolic linear
algebra, particularly using black box matrix methods, i.e. iterative 
methods requiring only the linear transform property of the matrix
(that one can compute Ax --> y).
<p>
The project is supported by the National Science Foundation and CNRS.
