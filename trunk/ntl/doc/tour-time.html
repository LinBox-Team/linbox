Some Performance Data 
</p>
</h1>

<p>

NTL is high-performance software,
offering high-quality implementations of the best algorithms.
Here are some timing figures from the current version of NTL.
The figures were obtained using an IBM RS6000 Workstation, Model 43P-133,
which has a 133 MHz PowerPC Model 604 processor.
The operating system is AIX and the compiler is xlC.
The compiler options were 
<tt>-O2  -qarch=ppc</tt>
and the NTL flags <tt>NTL_AVOID_FLOAT</tt> and <tt>NTL_TBL_REM</tt>
were set.

<p>

The first problem considered is the factorization of 
univariate polynomials modulo a prime <var>p</var>.
As test polynomials, we take the family of polynomials
defined in [V. Shoup, J. Symb. Comp. 20:363-397, 1995].
For every <var>n</var>, we define <var>p</var> 
to be the first prime greater than
<var>2^(n-2)*PI</var>, and the polynomial is 
<p>
<var>sum(a[n-i]*X^i, i = 0..n), </var>
<p>
where <var>a[0] = 1</var>, and <var>a[i+1] = a[i]^2 + 1.</var>
Here are some running times:

<p>
<table cellpadding=10>
<tr>
<td> <var>n</var> <td> 64 <td> 128 <td> 256 <td> 512 <td> 1024 
<tr>
<td> hh:mm:ss <td> 2 <td> 13 <td> 1:53 <td> 21:01 <td> 4:05:25
</table>

<p>
Also of interest is space usage.
The <var>n</var> = 512 case used 4MB main memory, 
and the <var>n</var> = 1024 case used 17 MB main memory.

<p>
Another test suite, this time using small primes,
was used by Kaltofen and Lobo (Proc. ISSAC '94).
One of their polynomials is a degree 10001 polynomial,
modulo the prime 127.
This polynomial was factored with NTL in just over 3 hours,
using 17MB of memory.


<p>

The second problem considered is factoring univariate polynomials 
over the integers.
This test suite comes from <a href="http://www.loria.fr/~zimmerma">
Paul Zimmermann </a>.
The polynomial <var>P1(X)</var> has
degree 156, coefficients up to 424 digits, and 36 factors 
(12 of degree 2, 15 of degree 4, 9 of degree 8). The
polynomial <var>P2(X)</var> has degree 196, 
coefficients up to 419 digits and 12 factors 
(2 of degree 2, 4 of degree 12 and
6 of degree 24). 
The polynomial <var>P3(X)</var> has degree 336, 
coefficients up to 597 digits and 16 factors (4 of degree
12 and 12 of degree 24). 
The polynomial <var>P4(X)</var> has degree 462, 
coefficients up to 756 digits, and two factors
of degree 66 and 396.
The polynomial <var>P5(X)</var> has degree 64, coefficients of up to 40
digits, and is irreducible.
It is a so-called Swinnerton-Dyer polynomial,
which is one of the most difficult types to factor (or prove irreducible).
<a href="http://www.loria.fr/~zimmerma/mupad"> More details </a> 
on this test suite are available.

<p>

Our running times (hh:mm:ss) were as follows:
<pre>
   15, 21, 1:12, 3:56, 2:17.
</pre>
In all cases less than 5MB of main memory was used.
These times reflect significant improvements to
the factorizer available since version 3.6a.
As a comparison, here are the corresponding times in version 3.5a:
<pre>
   21, 23, 1:16, 1:37:10, 1:25:00.
</pre>
In addition to the above polynomials, Zimmermann has recently
added a challenge polynomial <var>P8(X)</tt> to his list
of challenge polynomials.
This is a particularly hard-to-factor polynomial, but using
new techniques, we were able to prove that it is irreducible
in time <tt>1:41:00</tt> using 128MB of memory on a 375MHz PowerPC
(model 43P-150).
This technique is based on a time/space tradeoff.
For example, using 64MB of memory, the running time for the
same calculation was <tt>2:40:00</tt>.

<p>
NTL's lattice basis reduction code has been used to push the envelope
on breaking new lattice-based cryptosystems.
To date, NTL's lattice code has been used to break the
GGH cryptosystem [Goldreich, Goldwasser, Halevi, Crypto '97]
up to dimension 350.
These experiments were designed
and conducted by
