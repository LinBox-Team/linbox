NTL  -- a library for doing numbery theory --  version 3.7a

Author: Victor Shoup (victor@shoup.net)

NTL is freely available for research and educational purposes.
I don't want to attach any legalistic licensing restrictions on
users of NTL.  However, NTL should not be linked in a commercial program
(although using data in a commercial product produced by a program 
that used NTL is fine).


Documentation is available in the file doc/tour.html, which can
be viewed with a web browser.

The latest version of NTL is available at www.shoup.net.
