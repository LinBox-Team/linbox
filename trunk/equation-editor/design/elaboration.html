    <h1>Equation Editor for GNOME</h1>

    <p>
      <b>Customer</b>: The free software (GNOME) community
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Rationale:</b>
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	Cost: Typsetting and displaying mathematical text is a very
	complex process that involves deep knowledge of the underlying 
	theory. We can take code from existing sources (e.g., LaTeX
	and Mozilla), but there may be licensing issues that complicate
	that.
      </li>

      <li>
	Benefit: The GNOME productivity applications need an interface 
	for high-quality mathematical typesetting from within a word
	processor, licensed unrestrictively.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <b>Goal:</b> Create an embeddable, interactive interface for
      mathematical typesetting, display, and editing. This interface
      could work standalone or equivalently be accessible from a
      Bonobo container, e.g. a word processor.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Scope:</b> We plan to abstract from some existing source the
      code to typeset and render the mathematical text, so as to make
      compliance with existing standards easier. So, display and
      typesetting should be relatively feature-complete assuming we do 
      not run into problems with licensing. We will also implement the 
      functionality for user input as well as a GUI to allow the
      program to run standalone. Persistence (i.e., saving to disk)
      will also be implemented, using Bonobo to permit embedding as a
      component in other documents. We will not implement
      import/export functionality at this time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through the use of the Bonobo component model, we will obtain
      many capabilities for free. For example, embedding a renderer
      using this program inside a symbolic manipulation package is a
      natural consequence of the component system. However, provided
      that we have enough time, we will develop a CORBA-based API to
      allow other programs and scripts to interface with the equation
      editor. This will provide a wealth of new capabilities. We do
      not intend to implement any form of symbolic, algebraic, or
      numerical manipulation or computation.
    </p>
