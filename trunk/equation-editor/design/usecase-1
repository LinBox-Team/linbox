Use Case: Use as a rendering engine in symbolic manipulator
Actor(s): User, symbolic manipulator
Purpose: Typeset and render symbolic expressions correctly from within
a symbolic manipulation package similar to Maple
-------------------------
Description: 

User enters commands processed by the symbolic manipulator. Symbolic
manipulator invokes the rendering part of the equation editor
(probably as a Bonobo component) to display output. Output is of high
(TeX-style) quality.

Alternative courses:

1. User enters symbolic expressions using the equation editor
component. The equation editor then passes them on to the symbolic
manipulator.

2. User elects to embed one or more symbolic expressions output in
this fashion in a word processing or other document.
