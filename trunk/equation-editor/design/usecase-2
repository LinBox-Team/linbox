Use Case: Embed display into a word processor
Actor(s): Word processor user
Purpose: Allow users of a word processor interface with the Gnome
display to embed mathematical equations into a document.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description:

The embedded program would allow the user to access its functions by
either a menu or hot key. This program will open in a separate window
within which the user would create the mathematical equation needed
and when done, the program will fit this equation into the document
anywhere the user specifies. The user can then continue with typing
the document. The inserted equation can be accessed by clicking on it
or by a menu or hot key. It can then be changed and moved to suit
user.

Alternate Courses:

Could allow equation, once created and embedded, to be manipulated by
the host program. This could include font, size, and properties.
