GNOME Equation Editor (Erdös) 0.0.1
Copyright (C) 2000 Helix Code, Inc., Matt Spilich, Rob Wehde, Anthony Asher

This program is a math formula editor embeddable as a Bonobo component
(see http://www.helixcode.com/tech/bonobo.php3 for more information on
Bonobo). It allows one to create mathematical formulae standalone or
(in a more useful sense) embedded in another document such as a word
processor or a spreadsheet.

The program is currently alpha-quality. Basic formula editing works,
but many more advanced features are not present.

To compile the program, you need:

OAF >= 0.5.1
(ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/oaf/oaf-0.6.1.tar.gz)
Bonobo == 0.23
(ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/bonobo/bonobo-0.23.tar.gz)

GNOME 1.2 Libraries and their dependencies (http://www.helixcode.com/desktop/)
