GNOME Equation Editor (Erdös) 0.0.1
Copyright (C) 2000 Helix Code, Inc., Matt Spilich, Rob Wehde, Anthony Asher

This program is a math formula editor embeddable as a Bonobo component
(see http://www.helixcode.com/tech/bonobo.php3 for more information on
Bonobo). It allows one to create mathematical formulae standalone or
(in a more useful sense) embedded in another document such as a word
processor or a spreadsheet.

The program is currently alpha-quality. Basic formula editing works,
but many more advanced features are not present.

To compile the program, you need:

OAF >= 0.5.1
(ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/oaf/oaf-0.6.1.tar.gz)
Bonobo == 0.23
(ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/bonobo/bonobo-0.23.tar.gz)

GNOME 1.2 Libraries and their dependencies (http://www.helixcode.com/desktop/)

Installation instructions may be found in the file INSTALL.

When the program is built, there will be two binaries in the src/
directory. The binary `equation-editor' is the component
proper. Please do not run it directly as it is designed to be launched
from a Bonobo container. If you run it directly, it will not do
anything (except register the service with your OAF daemon so that
future containers can make use of it).

The program `test' is a small standalone program that creates a model,
view, and controller. If you wish to see the equation editor in all
its glory and do not have a Bonobo container in which to run it, you
may use this program.
