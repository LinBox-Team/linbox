This directory consists of the client side code for the Linbox web service.  It
consists of:

- TransferAgentStandAloneClient.java: This file is the client side code that 
 takes a matrix and an operation and calls the Linbox web service located on 
 the machine 'hmrg.'  It then returns the results to the user.  Used in 
 conjunction with another class that does something with the result.

- TransferAgentDependentClient.java: This file is the client side code that 
 takes a matrix and an operation and calls the Linbox web service located on 
 the machine 'hmrg.'  It then returns the results to the user by printing them
 to the screen.
