<h1> How to Use the Webform Version of the Service</h1>

<h2> <u>Overview </h2></u> <br>
The webform hosted on this site is an example of a client to the LinBox webservice.  This
webform client is hosted on linalg.org and calls one of the computing servers on another
machine.  You can use this webform client to make calls to LinBox without having to
download and mainain the LinBox library yourself.  
<br>
<br>

<h2><u> Using the Webform Version of the Service </h2></u> <br>
To use the service, <a href="http://www.linalg.org:8080/LinalgComputingClient.jsp" target="_blank">click here. </a>  You can then select an operation that you
wish to perform.  The current choices are:
<ul>
  <li><b>Rank</b></li>
  <li><b>Determinant</b></li>
  <li><b>Valence*</b></li>
  <li><b>Trace</b></li>
</ul>

You can find common definitions of rank, determinant, and trace on Wikipedia.<br><br>

*By LinBox tradition we use the name <i>valence</i>  for the lowest degree nonzero
coefficient of the minimal polynomial of the matrix. By blackbox methods, the valence may 
be computed more cheaply than the full minimal polynomial. The valence contains all those
primes which occur in the largest invariant factor of the matrix. 
<br>
<br>

Then enter a matrix.  You can either upload a matrix file or select one of several
example matrices.  Click submit to perform the calculation.  Note that if you incorrectly
enter matrix data then LinBox may not be able to complete the operation.  <br>
