April 2011:
* Ported library to autotools
* Starting porting tests/ for "make check"
* Updated fields with LinBox (which depends fully on them now)
* removed as many _LINBOX_LINBOX_CONFIG_H as possible
* added utils/ for utilities. Also used by LinBox. Will probably turn into some
  sort of common utils/ shared by Givaro/LinBox/Fflas-Ffpack
* minor bugs corrected
* some documentation (+framework) added.
