Class names:

	In general: Most class names now follow the Java/Smalltalk
	MyClass style. Abbreviations have been removed in most cases.

	Field::randIter -> Field::RandIter

	sparsemat* -> SparseMatrix*

	diagonal -> Diagonal
	hilbert -> Hilbert
	etc.

	There are two notable exceptions: The wrapper of GMP long
	integers is "integer", and field elements are represented by
	"element".

	ParamGivaro::Modular was first renamed LargeModular, since it works
	over a modulus of arbitrary size. Corresponding SmallGivaro::Modular
	(word size modulus) and TinyGivaro::Modular (half-word size modulus)
	were planned.  All of this has become Givaro::Modular<element>, for
	basic element types of the various sizes, including unsigned 
	and floating types.  For example Givaro::Modular<uint32>.

Class methods:

	In general: I have standardized everything on the Java
	studlycaps style, e.g. MyClass::myMethod

	The names Blackbox_archetype::applyin and
	Blackbox_archetype::applyTransposein have been changed to
	BlackboxArchetype::applyIn and
	BlackboxArchetype::applyTransposeIn, respectively.

Header files:

	All header files that previously used '_' to separate words
	use '-' now as '-' is easier to type.  More generally the 
	header file named first-second-third.h can be expected to 
	contain a declaration of class FirstSecondThird.

	The archetype header files have been moved into directories
	containing objects of those archetypes and are all now named
	"archetype.h", "abstract.h", and "envelope.h".

	Header files are now installed into a tree matching that of
	the source code as opposed to a single, flat directory. So,
	for example, one now includes LinBox/blackbox/archetype.h as
	opposed to LinBox/blackbox-archetype.h

Miscellanae:

	In the random iterator interface, the operator () has been
	replaced by a function random accepting a single argument --
	an element type into which the random element should be
	placed. This eliminates the potential for memory leaks.

	The blackbox container class now requires that a field be
	passed, as it no longer retrieves the field from the black
	box.

        Some terms composed of more than one word are considered to be
        compound words and do not have internal capitalization, e.g. Blackbox
        (vs. BlackBox) and minpoly (vs. minPoly).

Frozen design:

	These files are frozen and require team consensus for changes.

	field-archetype.h
	blackbox-archetype.h
	element-archetype.h
	randiter-archetype.h
