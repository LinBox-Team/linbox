\section{Lie Groups and Representations} %section 2

\begin{verbatim}
Jeff explains the Lie group setting,
In particular the Weyl groups, 
the wonderful huge E8, and all that.
A bit about root systems, what the interest 
is in the operators constructed
from facets...
..What the operators and facets mean 
and why it is useful or informative 
to compute signatures or determine definiteness.

Possibly comment on value of other integer 
matrix computation to Lie Group study.
