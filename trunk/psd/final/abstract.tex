A key step in the computation of the unitary dual of a Lie group is
the determination if certain rational symmetric matrices are positive
semi-definite. The size of some of the computations dictates that high
performance integer matrix computations be used.  We explore the
feasibility of this approach by developing three algorithms for
integer symmetric matrix signature and studying their performance both
asymptotically and by experimenting on a particular matrix family
constructed from the exceptional Weyl group $E_8$.  We conclude that the
computation is doable, with a parallel implementation needed for the
largest representations.
