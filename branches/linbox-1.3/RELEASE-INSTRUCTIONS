Instructions for making a LinBox release:

1. Run 'svn up ' to make sure you are fully up to date and on the
   HEAD branch [1]
2. Update the version number in Makefile.am next to 'VERSION = ', and in configure.in:3
3. Run 'make distcheck' on your local copy of LinBox. If there are any
   problems, fix them and commit the fixes to CVS. Usually problems
   will be things like header files that are not being installed, but
   should be. Make sure 'make distcheck' runs once without having any
   errors before moving onto the next step. Also, record all of the
   changes you make in ChangeLog.
4. Add a ChangeLog entry for Makefile.am with the text 'New version
   <version>' where <version> is the version you are releasing.
5. Make sure everything in your local copy of LinBox is committed. In
   particular, either commit or eliminate anything from step 1 that
   was marked modified.
6. Run 'make dist' (or 'make distcheck') so that the last ChangeLog
   entry is included in your tarball.
7. Copy the tarball produced in step 6 to the web server.
8. Update the LinBox web site with information on the new release --
   mention it in news.html and update the latest version information
   in index.html and download.html

[1] Of course, this assumes that you want to release from the head
    branch. If HEAD represents the development version and you
    actually want to release from a stable branch, you should use
      cvs up -dP -r linbox-<version>
    where <version> is the version identifier in the stable branch
