The headers in this scr directory constitute the generic superlu implementation.

Most of the X.h files here are adapted from X.c in the SuperLU distribution so that the 
entry arithmetic may be from an arbitrary field (Linbox representation).

A few of the header files allow for additional computations (more often useful over finite fields).
For example
  determinant.h provides for use of LU to compute det(A).
  // todo: rank.h provides for exact rank via LU (sensible over a finite field).
