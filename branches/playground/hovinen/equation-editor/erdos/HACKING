HACKING

    I would prefer that you not work on this without contacting me
      first.  I don't feel that it's time yet to start adding support
      for all of the tags that mathml supports.  The architecture
      needs to be finished first, and for that, you should talk to me
      about what needs to be done.  I'd love help with the
      architecture.  Please contact me if you have any ideas or want
      to contribute.

    Thanks,
       Chris Lahey <clahey@umich.edu>
