Obtaining and Installing NTL for Windows 
and other Platforms
</p>
</h1>

<p>

The WinNTL distribution of 
NTL can be used on any Windows 95 or NT platform
(but not on Windows 3.11 or earlier).
Actually, there is nothing Windows-specific about WinNTL.
The source code is identical to the UNIX NTL distribution;
only the packaging is slightly different, and no assumptions
are made about the program development environment.
Thus, it should be possible to install WinNTL on
other operating systems (e.g., Macintosh, OS/2)
with little difficulty.

<p>

To obtain the source code and documentation for NTL,
<a href="http://www.shoup.net/ntl/download.html">
download WinNTL-xxx.zip</a>.
Here, "<tt>xxx</tt>" is the current version number.
Then "unzip" this file into a directory (folder).
This will unpack everything into a directory called "WinNTL-xxx".
Inside this directory, you will find several directories.

<p>

The directory "doc" contains all of NTL's documentation,
including this "tour" ("tour.html")
and the ".txt" files explaining each module,
which can be accessed directly, or through the "tour".

<p>

The directory "src"
contains all of the source files for the library,
all with ".cpp" extensions.
The file "lip.cpp" can be compiled as a C source file
(this can sometimes yield a marginal performance gain).

<p>

The directory "include" contains a single directory called "NTL",
and the latter contains all of the ".h" files.

<p>

In directory "include/NTL" there is a file called "mach_desc.h",
which contains all of the platform-dependent macro definitions.
The default settings should be correct for any x86- or Pentium-
based system running Windows; however, the correct definitions
can depend on the compiler and run-time environment.
Therefore, to be on the safe side,
you might consider compiling and running the program "MakeDesc",
whose source files are in directory "MakeDesc".
This program will
dynamically build
a correct "mach_desc.h" for your platform (processor, compiler, 
run-time environment).
To get accurate results,
you must compile this program using the level of optimization 
(or higher) that you will use for NTL.
The program will print some diagnostics to the screen, 
and create the file "mach_desc.h" (in the current
directory, and not in the "include/NTL" directory,
where it needs to go).

<p>

Also in directory "include/NTL" is a file called "config.h".
By editing this file, you can override some of NTL's default
code generation strategies.
Changing these settings only affects performance, not correctness.
You can completely ignore this file,
unless you are really concerned about getting the most performance
out of your machine.
See "config.h" for details.


<p>

The directory "tests" contains several test programs.
For each program <tt>FooTest</tt>, there is a source file
"FooTest.cpp", and optionally two files 
"FooTestIn" and "FooTestOut".
If the latter  exist, then the program should be run with
the "FooTestIn" as standard input;
correct output (printed to standard output) should match
the contents of "FooTestOut" exactly;
note that these programs also print diagnostic output on the screen
(through standard error output).

<p>

The directory "GetTime" contains several alternative
definitions of the GetTime() function.
The file "GetTime.cpp" in the "src" directory should be OK,
but your compiler might like one of the definitions in
the directory "GetTime" better.

<p>

The directory "newnames" contains a program to help make the
transition to NTL version 3.5.
See the <a href="tour-changes.html">changes</a> section for more details.


<p>

Since there are a number of incompatible compilers and program development
environments available for Windows, no attempt has been made to
provide automatic tools for building and testing,
as is done for the Unix distribution.
Nevertheless,
it should be straightforward to install NTL (even if it involves a bit of
pointing and clicking).
First, compile all of the files in "src", and create a static library.
Make sure the compiler knows where to find NTL's include files
(directory "include" and <i>not</i> "include/NTL")
Then, to compile a program using the library, 
make sure the compiler knows about the library and the directory
of NTL's include files.
In any case, if you want to do any serious computations,
you will certainly  want to compile everything with your
compiler's code optimizer on.

<p>
NTL has been successfully installed and tested 
on Windows 95 platforms with both the 
Microsoft and Borland compilers.

<p>
If you are using Windows but have some kind of Unix development
toolkit, then you might try using the Unix distribution of NTL.
I've never tried this, so I have no idea if it works.
