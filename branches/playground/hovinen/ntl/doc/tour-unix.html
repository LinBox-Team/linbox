Obtaining and Installing NTL for UNIX 
</p>
</h1>

<p>

To obtain the source code and documentation for NTL,
<a href="http://www.shoup.net/ntl/download.html">
download ntl-xxx.tar.gz</a>,
placing it a directory, and then, working in this directory,
do the following.
Here, "<tt>xxx</tt>" denotes the current version number.

<p>
<b>Step 1.</b>
Extract the source files by executing:
<pre>
   % gunzip ntl-xxx.tar.gz
   % tar xvf ntl-xxx.tar
</pre>

<p>
Note that this will unpack everything into a sub-directory <tt>ntl-xxx</tt>,
creating this directory if necessary.
Next:
<pre>
   % cd ntl-xxx
   % ls
</pre>
You should see a file "README", and directories "include", "doc", and "src".
The directory "doc" contains all the documentation.
The file "doc/tour.html" contains a copy of the on-line documentation.
The directory "include" contains all the header files within a subdirectory
"include/NTL".
The directory "src" contains everything else.
Go there now:
<pre>
   % cd src
</pre>

<p>
<b>Step 2.</b>
Edit the makefile.

<p>

There is a makefile, called "makefile", which you might need to edit just a little.
You need to specify a <tt>C++</tt> compiler, and optionally,
a compatible <tt>C</tt> compiler.
A few source files are written in pure <tt>C</tt>,
and will compile under <tt>C</tt> or <tt>C++</tt>, but 
using a <tt>C</tt> compiler sometimes yields better code.
There are a few compiler options you may want to set as well.
These are described in the makefile.

<p>
The default settings in the makefile use 
the Gnu compilers <tt>g++</tt> and <tt>gcc</tt>.
In fact, if you are using Gnu, you should not have to
edit the makefile at all.

<p>
<b>Step 3.</b>
Set NTL flags.

<p>
There is a file called "../include/NTL/config.h".
You can edit this file to override some of NTL's default
settings to get better code for certain platforms.
Setting these flags only affects the performance of NTL code,
not its correctness.
In fact, I recommend you do not even worry about this file:
the default settings should work fine.
But see the documentation in this file for more details,
especially if you want to get the most performance out of
your machine.


<p>
<b>Step 4.</b>
Execute <tt>make</tt>.

<p>
Just type:
<pre>
   % make
</pre>

<p>
The build  process after this point is fully automatic.
But here is a description of what happens.

<p>
The first thing that the makefile does is to 
build the file "../include/NTL/mach_desc.h", which defines some machine characteristics
such as word size and machine precision.
This is done by compiling and running a <tt>C</tt> program
called <tt>MakeDesc</tt>
that figures out these characteristics on its
own, and prints some diagnostics to the terminal.

<p>
After this, the makefile will compile all the source files,
and then create the library "ntl.a" in the current directory.

<p>
Finally, the makefile compiles and runs a series of test programs.
The output generated should indicate if there are any problems.

<p>
<b>After NTL is built.</b>

<p>
Executing <tt>make clean</tt> will remove unnecessary object files.

<p>
Executing <tt>make clobber</tt> removes <i>everything</i> that
was generated by a previous installation.
<i>Make sure you do this if you re-build NTL for a different architecture!</i>

<p>
When linking a program, you need to include ntl.a and -lm
as libraries.
If you have a driver program "foo.c",
just execute <tt>make foo</tt> to build the program <tt>foo</tt>.
This will work, of course, only if you are working in NTL's "src" directory.

<p>
Of course, you may want to put the compiled library "ntl.a",
as well as the "doc" and "include" directories in some more convenient place
as a final part of the installation procedure.

<p>
The compilation should run smoothly on just about any UNIX platform.
The only real trouble I've ran into is the GNU compiler for PowerPC.
The release I have has a code generation bug for which 
I've found no easy work-around.
I've been told that the bug has been fixed in an upcoming release.
The IBM AIX compilers xlc/xlC, however, work fine.
