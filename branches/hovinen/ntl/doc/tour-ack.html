Acknowledgements

<p>

<ul>

<li>
Thanks to Arjen Lenstra (arjen.lenstra@citicorp.com) 
and 
<a href="http://epidem13.plantsci.cam.ac.uk/~kbriggs">Keith Briggs</a>
for letting me use their software.
Arjen Lenstra wrote LIP, a long integer package, which formed
the basis of NTL.
Keith Briggs developed a quadratic precision package.
NTL has incorporated parts of these two packages, although
what is in NTL has been extensively re-written.

<li>
Thanks to 
<a href="http://math-www.uni-paderborn.de/~jngerhar">Juergen Gerhard</a>
for pointing out the deficiency in the NTL-1.0 ZZX arithmetic,
for contributing the Schoenhage/Strassen code to NTL 1.5,
and for helping to track down some bugs.

<li>
Thanks to 
<a href="http://www.dmi.ens.fr/~pnguyen">Phong Nguyen</a> for
putting the new LLL code (NTL 1.7) through a torture test of 
lattices arising from new lattice-based cryptosystems;  this
led to a number of significant improvements in the LLL code.

<li>
Thanks to <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~dabo">Dan Boneh</a>
for encouraging me to improve NTL's
programming interface.  

<li>
Thanks to John Abbott (abbott@dima.unige.it) for sharing many of his ideas about
polynomial factoring over <tt>ZZ</tt> with me, which
led to a number of improvements in NTL's factorizer.
