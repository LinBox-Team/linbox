Introduction
</p>
</h1>


<p>
NTL is a high-performance, portable C++ library providing
data structures and algorithms 
for arbitrary length integers;
for vectors, matrices, and polynomials over the integers and over
finite fields; and for arbitrary precision floating point arithmetic.

<p>
NTL provides high quality implementations of state-of-the-art
algorithms for:

<ul>

<li>
arbitrary length integer arithmetic and arbitrary precision
floating point arithmetic;

<li> 
polynomial arithmetic over the integers and finite fields
including basic arithmetic, polynomial factorization, 
irreducibility testing, 
computation
of minimal polynomials, traces, norms, and more;

<li>
lattice basis reduction, including very robust and fast implementations
of Schnorr-Euchner, block Korkin-Zolotarev reduction,
and the new Schnorr-Horner pruning heuristic for
block Korkin-Zolotarev;

<li>
basic linear algebra over the integers, 
finite fields, and arbitrary precision
floating point numbers.

</ul>

<p>
NTL's polynomial arithmetic is one of the fastest available anywhere,
and has been used to set "world records" for polynomial factorization
and determining orders of elliptic curves.


<p>
NTL's lattice reduction code is also one of the best available anywhere,
in terms of both speed and robustness, and one of the few 
implementations of
block Korkin-Zolotarev reduction with the Schnorr-Horner pruning heuristic.
It has been used to "crack" several cryptosystems.


<p>
NTL can be easily installed in a matter of minutes 
on just about any platform,
including virtually any 32- or 64-bit machine running
any flavor of Unix,
as well as PCs running Windows 95, 98, or NT, and Macintoshes.
NTL achieves this portability by avoiding esoteric C++ features,
and by avoiding assembly code; it should therefore remain usable
for years to come with little or no maintenance, even as
processors and operating systems continue to change and evolve.
However, several
compile-time flags can be set to tune the code
for a particular type of platform.


<p>
NTL provides a clean and consistent interface to
a large variety of classes representing mathematical objects.
It provides a good environment for easily 
and quickly implementing new
number-theoretic algorithms, <em>without sacrificing performance</em>.

<p>
NTL is written and maintained by 
<a href="http://www.shoup.net">Victor Shoup</a>
with some contributions made by others
(see <a href="tour-ack.html">Acknowledgements</a>).

<h2>
Legalistic Nonsense
</p>
</h2>
<p>
NTL is freely available for research and educational purposes.
I don't want to attach any legalistic licensing restrictions on
users of NTL.
However, NTL should not be linked in a commercial program
(although using data in a commercial
product produced by a program that used NTL is fine).
