<h1>Using the Webform Portal to the LinBox Webservice</h1>

<h2> <u>Overview </h2></u> <br>
LinBox is a "C++ template library for exact,
high-performance linear algebra computation with dense, sparse, and structured
matrices over the integers and over finite fields."  <b>LinBox can be used to
perform massive matrix computations</b> that programs like Matlab and Maple 
could not solve.  Furthermore, LinBox is constantly being updated and improved,
with special considerations for potential users. <br> <br>

However, this power comes with a price.  It is not always practical or
desirable to download the entire LinBox library, as the entire download may
not be necessary for only a few computations.  Also, since LinBox is constantly
in flux, the users would need to stay up to date with the frequent downloads.
Finally, since LinBox is a "template library," it is not always easy
for the user to run a program and quickly get an answer.  This prompted the
need for another way of using LinBox. <br> <br>

The creation of a web service for LinBox <b> makes it easy to use the LinBox
library.</b>  A web service is "a software system designed to support 
interoperable Machine to Machine interaction over a network" (Wikipedia).  The web service
solves the above problems with LinBox.  First and foremost, the user <b> no
longer needs to download the entire LinBox library</b> to perform a 
computation.  He or she simply needs to install the client code that accesses
the web service. Second, the web service's copy of LinBox  will be able to be
updated without any worry from the user.  Finally, the web service provides
several different methods that the user can simply input the data and receive
an answer.

<h2><u> Using the Service </h2></u> <br>
To use the service, <a href="http://www.linalg.org:2000/LinalgComputingClient.jsp" target="_blank">click here. </a>  You can then select an operation that you
wish to perform.  The current choices are:
<ul>
  <li><b>Rank</b>, the maximal number of linearly independent columns or rows of the matrix.</li>
  <li><b>Determinant</b>, given an <b>n x n</b> matrix <b>A</b> where <i>det(A) </i>= &Sigma; <sub> (i1i2...iN) </sub>&plusmn; a<sub>i<sub>1</sub></sub>a<sub>i<sub>2</sub></sub>...a<sub>i<sub>n</sub></sub>
</li>
  <li><b>Trace</b>, the sum of the elements on the main diagonal of the matrix.</li>
  <li><b>Smith Normal Form</b></li>
  <li><b>Valence</b></li>
</ul>

</label valence>
By LinBox tradition we use the name <i> valence </i> for the lowest degree nonzero coefficient of the minimal polynomial of the matrix.  By blackbox methods, the valence may be computed more cheaply than the full minimal polynomial.  The valence contains all those primes which occur in the largest invariant factor of the matrix.

Then enter a matrix.  You can either upload a matrix file or input the matrix by hand.  Click submit to perform the calculation.  Note that if you incorrectly enter matrix data then LinBox may not be able to complete the operation.  <br>
