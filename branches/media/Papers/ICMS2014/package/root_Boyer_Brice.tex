%================================================

%=== If you need additional package =============
%
% The publisher sets
%     - layout
%     - font class
%     - citation style
%     - hyperref style
%     - etc
% uniformly throughout the proceedings.
% Hence, you should NOT add/modify them.
% Otherwise, it will cause much delay,
% and the proceedings might not be ready for the conference.
%
% In fact, you should make you best effort not to add any additional packages.
%
% If you should add, make sure that they are absolutely required
% for __logical__ correctness of the presentation
% not for preferences on appearances.
%
% 1. Let "xyz" be the name of an absolutely required additional LaTeX package.
%    Then add the following line
%
%        \usepackage{xyz}
%
%    into the "DO NOT MODIFY" section above.
%
% 2. Send __immediately__ the names of the packages to the PC chair
%
%          hong@ncsu.edu
%
%    This is _MUST_.
%    Otherwise, the publisher will not be able to process your paper correctly.
%================================================

%====== MUST MODIFY =============================
% Replace "FamilyName_GivenName" below with the name of the author.
% If there are several authors, then use the name appearing first on the paper.
% It should match exactly the name of the child folder.
