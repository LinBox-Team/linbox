README for linbox-server

This module holds the current version of the LinBox server, which is in two
parts:
(1) The server-interface is contained in the ComputationServer directory.
	This is a user-friendly interface that is designed to run on the web
	independent of any LinBox installation.  It is designed with
	JavaServerPages and is meant to run with Apache Tomcat 5.0.
	You can download Apache Tomcat from http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat
	To install, type "make server-interface [[option-name=option-value]...]"
	where options are:
		HOST_NAME: The name of the host where there is a running
			LinBoxComputingServer to use.  Default is "localhost"
		PORT: The number of the port on HOST_NAME where the server can
			be found.
		MATRIX_DIR: Temp directory to hold generated matrix files
		COMPUTATION_DIR: Temp directory to hold computation backups.
		BASE_ADDRESS: Web address that will be the base for this
			instance of the server.  Default is
			"http://localhost:8080/ComputationServer".
		TEMP_DIR: Optionally, specify one directory that will serve as
			the MATRIX_DIR and the COMPUTATION_DIR
	This will generate a file "ComputationServer.war" in the
	ComputationServer directory.  This war ("web archive") can then be
	deployed to Tomcat.
(2) The computing-server is contained in the LinBoxComputingServer directory.
	This is the server, running in the background, which depends on LinBox
	and performs computations as requested by a ComputationServer (above).
	To install, type "make computing-server [[option-name=option-value]...]"
	where options are:
		PORT: The port number on which to listen for connections
		TIMEOUT: The amount of time, in seconds, to wait between retries
			when the connection is dropped.  Default is 1.
		LINBOX_FOLDER: Folder where an installed copy of LinBox can be
			found (e.g. "/home/LinBoxUser/linbox")
		COMPUTING_SERVER_TEMP_DIR: Temp directory to hold matrix files
			while computations are running.
		TEMP_DIR: Optionally, specify the COMPUTATION_SERVER_TEMP_DIR
			in this option.  Useful if compiling server-interface
			at the same time.
	This will compile all necessary files.  To run the server, type
	"java LinBoxComputingServer.ComputingServer"

Both of these parts depend on an installation of java, version 1.4 or later.
The tools "java" "javac" and "jar" can be put in the path, or their location
can be specified by setting the Makefile variable or environment variable
"JAVADIR" to the appropriate directory.
