  Project \URL[LinBox]{http://www.cis.udel.edu/~caviness/linbox/}
  is a collaborative effort among researchers at a number of locations in 
  Europe and North America. The goals are to produce algorithms and software 
  for symbolic linear algebra, particularly using black box matrix methods, 
  i.e. iterative methods requiring only the linear transform property of the 
  matrix (that one can compute Ax --> y).

  The project is supported by the 
  \URL[National Science Foundation]{http://www.nsf.gov/} and CNRS.
