/*! @file examples/bigmat.C
 * @example  examples/bigmat.C
 * \ingroup examples
 * @brief Outputs a big and very sparse matrix.
 *
 * let C be the cyclic shift matrix with 1 on the 1,n position and along the first subdiagonal.
 *
 *  This matrix is \f$2C + 3I\f$. It has 2 nonzero entries per row and per column.
 *  It is an \f$ n \times n\f$ matrix whose determinant is considerably less than the
 *  Hadamard bound (but is large -- 3^n +- 2^n).
